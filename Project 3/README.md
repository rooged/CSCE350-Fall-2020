# Project 3 - Long Multiplication Two-Ways

## How To Use
- Run the .cpp
- Enter any integer followed by '*' then another integer (i.e. 1234*5678)

## Result
The program will multiply the two numbers together using two different algorithms.
The first is a standard multiplication algorithm I designed, the second is the Karatsuba algorithm.

#Note
The entered numbers are not stored as integers, each digit is stored as a vector index so the numbers can be **very** large.
Longest number I tested was 100 digits in length.
