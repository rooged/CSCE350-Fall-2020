# Project 4 - Create Shortest Palindrome

## How To Use
- Run the .cpp
- Enter any word in lowercase letters (i.e. tim)

## Result
The program will find the shortest possible palindrome that can be created from the entered word.
While finding the shortest possible palindrome, it builds the word at the same time.
