# Project 2 - Balance Teams

## How To Use
- Run the .cpp
- Enter any positive integer to represent the total number individuals you'll enter
- Enter a name followed by an integer (i.e. Tim 30)
- Repeat until you've entered the correct number of people

## Result
The program will autobalance the entered group into two teams so that the teams have exactly equal skill levels.
If multiple solutions are possible it'll return all possible solutions.
If an equal number can't be found then it'll return 'No solution'.
